sema:01,sema,0,0.05 mg,0.05,Microdose (low),"This is a subclinical dose, sometimes called a microdose, and is significantly below the starting doses used in standard clinical titration schedules. Controlled human efficacy data at this dose is extremely limited, so meaningful weight-loss or metabolic effects should not be assumed at a population level until more conclusive research is available.\n\nThis dose is sometimes used off-label for individuals who are highly sensitive to gastrointestinal side effects, as a lower-than-standard starting point to reduce side-effect burden before titrating up toward typical clinical doses. It is also sometimes used in microdosing protocols for purported secondary benefits; however, evidence for those secondary benefits at this dose is largely anecdotal, and more conclusive research is necessary before treating these claims as reliable at a population level.\n\nBecause the dose is small, dosing and measurement error becomes significantly more likely at this level, especially when concentration, device accuracy, or preparation methods vary.",,1

sema:03,sema,1,0.25 mg,0.25,Weeks 1-4  (standard starting dose),"Standard initiation dose at the start of the weight-management dose-escalation (titration) schedule. It is typically taken for weeks 1-4. It is primarily used to improve tolerability while the body adapts to appetite suppression and gastrointestinal side effects. In labeled weight-management schedules, 0.25 mg is an initiation dose and is not intended as a long-term maintenance dose.",,3
sema:04,sema,1,0.5 mg,0.5,Weeks 5-8,"Standard 2nd scheduled dose in weight-management schedule, escalating from the standard starter dose. It is typically taken for weeks 5-8. In labeled weight-management schedules, 0.5 mg is an escalation dose and is not intended as a long-term maintenance dose.",,4
sema:05,sema,1,1.0 mg,1,Weeks 9-12,"Standard 3rd scheduled dose in weight-management schedule. It is typically taken for weeks 9-12 of the standard dose-escalation period. In labeled weight-management schedules, 1.0 mg is an escalation dose and is not intended as a long-term maintenance dose.",,5
sema:06,sema,1,1.7 mg,1.7,Weeks 13-16 (possible maintenance),"Standard 4th scheduled dose in weight-management schedule, immediately before the maximum dose. It is typically taken for weeks 13-16. It is commonly used to stabilize tolerability before moving higher, and it is also an accepted maintenance option when higher dosing is not tolerated or not necessary. From week 17 onward, maintenance dosing may remain at 1.7 mg or increase to 2.4 mg.",,6
sema:07,sema,1,2.4 mg,2.4,Week 17+ (max / common maintenance),"Maximum dose in the standard weight-management schedule and the most common long-term maintenance target. It is typically reached from week 17 onward after a 16-week dose-escalation period. It is the dose most directly aligned with the pivotal weight-loss efficacy data for weight-management labeling. Tolerability still varies at this level, and dose reduction to a lower maintenance dose is sometimes used when side effects outweigh benefit.",,7

zep:05,zep,1,2.5 mg,2.5,Weeks 1-4 (initiation; NOT maintenance),Common labeled initiation tier: 2.5 mg once weekly for ~4 weeks. This is considered a starter dose mainly intended to improve tolerability before moving upward; it's generally not treated as a long-term maintenance goal.,,5
zep:06,zep,1,5 mg,5,Week 5+ (maintenance option) / after 2.5,"First typical maintenance-eligible tier after initiation. Many people spend multiple months here depending on response and side effects. If nausea/reflux is prominent, holding at 5 mg longer is a common strategy rather than escalating on a calendar.",,6
zep:07,zep,1,7.5 mg,7.5,Escalation step,Intermediate step used when titrating upward in 2.5 mg increments. Often used as a 'bridge' dose for tolerability; some users pause here if they're already seeing strong appetite suppression or if side effects flare with each increase.,,7
zep:08,zep,1,10 mg,10,Maintenance option,"A common higher maintenance tier. This is typically reached after spending adequate time at 5 mg (and often 7.5 mg). Side effects can reappear during escalation, so real-world titration often flexes around symptoms rather than a fixed schedule.",,8
zep:09,zep,1,12.5 mg,12.5,Escalation step,Another intermediate dose on the way to 15 mg. Useful when a patient wants to progress but experiences a tolerability wall with direct jumps; it can function as a 'soft landing' tier before attempting the max dose.,,9
zep:10,zep,1,15 mg,15,Max / maintenance option,"Highest common weekly tier in labeled-style regimens and a maintenance option for some. Not everyone tolerates or needs this dose; when side effects or excessive appetite suppression becomes problematic, a lower stable tier is often the practical endpoint.",,10
