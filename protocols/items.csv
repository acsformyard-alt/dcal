sema,incretins_metabolic_agonists,Semaglutide,1,Semaglutide is an FDA-approved weekly injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist commonly used for chronic weight management and/or for diabetes. Standard practice is to start low and escalate in steps in order to improve tolerability. Gastrointestinal side effects are common while aiming for a maintenance dose that produces meaningful appetite suppression and weight loss.,1
zep,incretins_metabolic_agonists,Tirzepatide,1,"Tirzepatide is an FDA-approved weekly injectable dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist used for weight management (and related indications). The dose is generally increased in 2.5 mg increments after spending at least about 4 weeks at each step, balancing appetite suppression and weight loss against GI tolerability and fatigue for the individual patient.",2
lira,incretins_metabolic_agonists,Liraglutide,1,"Liraglutide is an FDA-approved daily GLP-1 receptor agonist used for chronic weight management in some settings. Because it's taken every day, titration is typically week-by-week upward to a target maintenance dose, with adjustments based on nausea, reflux, constipation, and overall tolerability.",3
cagri,incretins_metabolic_agonists,Cagrilintide,0,"Cagrilintide is an investigational, long-acting amylin analogue studied for weight loss, including both fixed-dose arms and titration-to-target arms. It is not standard-of-care in typical clinical practice; the doses here reflect trial-style structures and are provided for protocol library/reference purposes—not as general medical guidance.",4
cagrisema,incretins_metabolic_agonists,CagriSema (Cagrilintide + Semaglutide),0,CagriSema is an investigational combination that pairs an amylin analogue (cagrilintide) with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (semaglutide). Trial-style protocols often titrate both components upward in parallel over multiple 4-week stages to improve tolerability while aiming for higher combined appetite suppression than either agent alone.,5
reta,incretins_metabolic_agonists,Retatrutide,0,"Retatrutide is an investigational multi-agonist (commonly described as acting across GIP/GLP-1 and glucagon pathways). Trial programs have used weekly dosing with structured escalation phases to reach different target tiers, aiming to balance potent weight loss effects against tolerability and safety monitoring in a research setting.",6
maz,incretins_metabolic_agonists,Mazdutide / IBI362,0,"Mazdutide (IBI362) is an investigational dual agonist (GLP-1 plus glucagon receptor activity) studied for weight loss and metabolic outcomes. Trial-style dosing often uses structured titration blocks to reach a target dose while managing tolerability, since glucagon-pathway activity can change side-effect and energy/balance profiles compared to pure GLP-1 agents.",7
survo,incretins_metabolic_agonists,Survodutide / BI 456906,0,"Survodutide (BI 456906) is an investigational dual agonist (GLP-1 plus glucagon receptor activity) studied for obesity and metabolic outcomes. Protocols commonly feature a long, conservative escalation phase to reach the assigned target dose, reflecting the need to manage tolerability while evaluating efficacy and safety under controlled study conditions.",8
ss31,mitochondrial_therapeutics,Elamipretide / SS-31,1,"Elamipretide (SS-31) is a mitochondria-targeting peptide drug with indication-specific clinical dosing in certain contexts. It is not a generic “performance” supplement protocol; dosing, administration route, and patient selection are tied to the clinical indication, and using it outside that framework should be treated as experimental and medically supervised.",1
motsc,mitochondrial_therapeutics,MOTS-c,0,"MOTS-c is a mitochondrial-derived peptide with a research literature that is largely preclinical and early/limited human work, without a widely accepted labeled or standardized clinical regimen. Because of that, this entry is best treated as a placeholder in your library unless you explicitly tie it to a specific published human protocol or registered clinical trial design.",2
